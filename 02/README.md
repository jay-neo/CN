### Configuration and Simulation using CISCO Packet Tracer
Design and Develop a network topology of a 100 Mbps Fast Ethernet LAN having two (2) 24-Port Switches. Each of the Switches is connected with a disjoint set of 10 nodes/ PCs configured with class C IP Address (192.168.4.41-60). Also add PDU to check ping implementing simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer.
